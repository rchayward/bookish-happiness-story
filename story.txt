My story beings in a dark place. Tyson Fury, former heavyweight champion of
the world, has ballooned to over 400 pounds. What used to be a powerful,
athletic frame is now a heaping mass on the couch. It's been about two years
since his last fight, and he doesn't feel any urge to get up off his couch.
He's struggled to even remember what it felt like to be a champion - to be
proud of his accomplishments. But today, today is the day he begins to turn
his life back around. Tyson looks himself in the mirror and says, "You're
going to be the heavyweight champion of the world again. You're going to 
knock out the Bronze Bomber, Deontay Wilder, in front of the entire world.
Your journey back to the top starts today."
However, Fury learned programming during his career. He stayed up late to 
perform his virtuosities in constructing a 2-3 tree. His weight dropped 
dramatically. 
Newly fit, Fury decided to pick back up his boxing career and hit the gym.  After months of training again, he was finally ready for The Big Fight.
